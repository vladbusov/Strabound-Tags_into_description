## Todo list:
- [x] Make a code for editing conf files of the game
- [x] Make useful .bat files for packing and unpacking .pak file
- [x] Make easy installable mode
- [x] Publish a mod to the Steam community https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2178954030
# WARNING! Don't forget to make a backup file .pak
#### Need to do:
* place .bat files into assets folder
* extract .pak files
* install the jsmin library for python
* add to code directory path of object game files
* run python file and place new .pak file or assets folder into assets of the game
###### The repository will be improved
